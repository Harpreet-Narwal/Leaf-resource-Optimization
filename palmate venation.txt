Algorithm:

Start

1)Initialize the ready queue to be empty.

2)Loop until all processes have completed:
a. Check the arrival time of all processes.
b. If a process has arrived, add it to the ready queue.
c. If the CPU is idle and there are processes in the ready queue:
i. Sort the ready queue by priority, with the highest priority process at the front.
ii. Remove the highest priority process from the front of the ready queue and execute it.
iii.Initialize the ready queue to be empty for the veins in the midrib.
iv. Loop until all processes have completed:
	a. Check the arrival time of all processes(veins).
	b. If a process has arrived, add it to the ready queue.
	c. If the CPU is idle and there are processes in the ready queue:
		i. Sort the ready queue by priority, with the highest priority process at the front.
		ii. Remove the highest priority process from the front of the ready queue and execute it.
		iii. If a process with higher priority than the currently executing process arrives, preempt the CPU and add the currently executing process back to the ready queue.
		iv. If the currently executing process finishes executing, mark it as complete and remove it from the system.
	d. If the CPU is not idle and a higher-priority process arrives, preempt the CPU and add the currently executing process back to the ready queue.

3)Calculate and output the average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time for all processes.

END.
